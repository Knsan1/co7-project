# Terraform Cloud Organization and Workspaces Setup

This Terraform configuration helps set up a Terraform Cloud organization, project, and workspaces connected to a GitHub repository. It automates the creation of workspaces for managing different parts of the infrastructure.

## Requirements

- **Terraform Cloud Account**
- **GitHub Repository**
- **OAuth connection between GitHub and Terraform Cloud**
- **TFE (Terraform Enterprise) API Token**

## Variables

- `organization_name`: Name of the Terraform Cloud organization. Default: `Hellocloud-kns`
- `project_name`: Name of the project in Terraform Cloud. Default: `HCP Vault Project`
- `repo_name`: GitHub repository to be connected. Default: `Knsan1/co7-project`
- `branch_name`: Branch of the GitHub repository. Default: `master`
- `workspaces`: Map of workspaces and their respective working directories.
  - Example:
    - `workspace01` -> `enable-vault-kv-engine`
    - `workspace02` -> `tfc-workspace`
    - `workspace03` -> `vault-cluster`
- `tag_names`: List of tags applied to workspaces (optional). Default: `["kns-hc", "test"]`

## What the Code Does

1. **Creates a Terraform Cloud Organization and Project**: 
   - Connects to your Terraform Cloud organization using the specified `organization_name` and `project_name`.
   
2. **Connects Terraform Cloud with GitHub**: 
   - Automatically links Terraform Cloud with your GitHub repository, using OAuth.
   - Uses the specified `repo_name` and `branch_name` for the VCS integration.

3. **Creates Multiple Workspaces**: 
   - The `workspaces` variable allows for defining multiple workspaces.
   - Each workspace is tied to a specific working directory (e.g., `enable-vault-kv-engine`).
   - Automatically applies tags defined in `tag_names`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and update variables if necessary.
2. Make sure your Terraform Cloud and GitHub are linked with OAuth.
3. **Set the TFE Token**: You'll need a Terraform Enterprise (TFE) API token for CLI-based workflows. To set the token:
   
   ```bash
   export TFE_TOKEN=<your-tfe-api-token>
   ```

4. Run the Terraform commands:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

   This will create the necessary Terraform Cloud resources and workspaces.

## Notes

- Ensure OAuth integration between GitHub and Terraform Cloud is manually established before running the code.
- Modify the `default` values in the variables block to match your environment if needed.
